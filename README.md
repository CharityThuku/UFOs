## Summary. 
- We created a webpage that displays our data and allows us to filter through specific data. The only drawback with the page is that we didn't add a portion to cite our sources in order for users to refer to. 
- If we could change anything about the project, we would have added more filters that allow us to search for more spicific data such as time a UFO was spotted. We also could have added ranges based on the year that the sighting occured.
